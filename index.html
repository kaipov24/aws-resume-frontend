      <section class="about">
        <p>
          I’m a software engineer with over <strong>4 years of frontend experience</strong> at
          <strong>Remote.com</strong>, building, scaling, and maintaining high-impact web experiences
          for a global audience. My background bridges design systems, content platforms, and
          performance optimization.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently, I’ve been expanding into <strong>DevOps and Cloud Engineering</strong> — bringing
          my frontend experience into infrastructure, automation, and CI/CD. I love connecting UI
          reliability with backend scalability and modern DevOps workflows.

          <p>
            This website demonstrates my full DevOps workflow — combining a static frontend,
            automated infrastructure, and CI/CD. It runs entirely on <strong>AWS</strong> with zero
            servers to manage.
          </p>

          <h4>Implementation Overview</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Built a responsive HTML/CSS/JS resume site hosted on <strong>Amazon S3</strong> with
              global HTTPS delivery via <strong>CloudFront</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implemented a visitor counter powered by <strong>API Gateway</strong> +
              <strong>Lambda (Python)</strong> + <strong>DynamoDB</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Wrote backend logic in Python using <strong>boto3</strong> and secured with CORS.
            </li>
            <li>
              Defined and deployed infrastructure using <strong>Terraform</strong> for full
              reproducibility.
            </li>
            <li>
              Automated deployments with <strong>GitHub Actions</strong>:
              <ul class="sublist">
                <li>
                  Frontend workflow: syncs S3 bucket + invalidates CloudFront cache on every push

                <li>
                  Backend workflow: tests Python code, validates Terraform, and deploys AWS
